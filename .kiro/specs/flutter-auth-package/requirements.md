# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Flutter authentication package that provides a modular authentication solution for Flutter applications. The package will handle user registration, login, profile management, and logout functionality through a REST API, allowing it to be easily integrated into multiple Flutter projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to integrate an authentication package into my project, so that I can quickly add user authentication without implementing it from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is added to a Flutter project THEN the system SHALL provide a simple API for authentication operations
2. WHEN the package is imported THEN the system SHALL expose authentication methods without requiring complex setup
3. WHEN the package is used THEN the system SHALL handle API communication with the backend automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an app user, I want to register for an account, so that I can access the application's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides email, display_name, password, and confirm_password THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/accounts/register/`
2. WHEN the registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response with verification details
3. WHEN the registration fails due to existing email THEN the system SHALL return field-specific error messages
4. WHEN passwords don't match THEN the system SHALL validate and return an error before making the API call
5. WHEN invalid email format is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and return an error
6. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL provide verification token expiration information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an app user, I want to log into my account, so that I can access my personalized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides email and password THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/accounts/login/`
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token securely
3. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL store user profile information including roles and onboarding status
4. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the token is received THEN the system SHALL make it available for subsequent API calls
6. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL provide redirect information for navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an app user, I want to view my profile information, so that I can see my account details and application status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests profile information THEN the system SHALL send a GET request to `/accounts/me/` with Authorization header
2. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive user profile data including roles, profile completion status, and onboarding information
3. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
4. WHEN the token is expired THEN the system SHALL handle the error appropriately
5. WHEN profile data is received THEN the system SHALL provide access to user roles, available roles, and profile completion status
6. WHEN profile data is received THEN the system SHALL provide onboarding status and redirect information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an app user, I want to log out of my account, so that I can secure my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests logout THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/logout/` with Authorization header
2. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL clear the stored authentication token
3. WHEN logout fails THEN the system SHALL still clear the local token for security
4. WHEN the user is already logged out THEN the system SHALL handle the request gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want the package to handle token management automatically, so that I don't need to manually manage authentication state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL automatically store the token securely
2. WHEN making authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL automatically include the Authorization header
3. WHEN the token expires THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to handle token refresh or re-authentication
4. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL persist the authentication state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can provide meaningful feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL parse and return server error messages
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return client-side validation errors
4. WHEN timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL return appropriate timeout error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want access to user role and profile information, so that I can customize the app experience based on user status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide access to user roles and permissions
2. WHEN user profile data is available THEN the system SHALL expose profile completion status for different roles
3. WHEN user profile data is available THEN the system SHALL provide onboarding completion status
4. WHEN user profile data is available THEN the system SHALL provide app access level information
5. WHEN user profile data changes THEN the system SHALL update the available information accordingly

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want the package to be easily testable, so that I can write unit tests for my authentication logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the package THEN the system SHALL provide mockable interfaces for testing
2. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL allow dependency injection for HTTP clients
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL provide test utilities and helpers
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL not require actual network calls
